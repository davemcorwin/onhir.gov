PROCEDURES FOR PROVIDING PERSONAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES (PAS) for EMPLOYEES WITH TARGETED DISABILITIES

This notice describes the process for employees with targeted disabilities to obtain Personal Assistance Services (PAS) at the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR). On September 18, 2017 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued the following statement:

“As part of the agencies’ obligation to engage in affirmative action, federal agencies are required by the new regulations to provide Personal Assistance Services (PAS) to individuals who need them because of certain disabilities. PAS are services that help individuals who, because of targeted disabilities, require assistance to perform basic activities of daily living, like removing and putting on clothing, eating and using the restroom.”

Pursuant to EEOC directives and amended regulations implementing Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the ONHIR will provide PAS to an individual if:

> · The individual is an employee of the Agency;
> 
> · The individual has a targeted disability;
> 
> · The individual requires the services because of their targeted disability;
> 
> · The individual will be able to perform the essential functions of the job without posing a direct threat to safety, once PAS and any required reasonable accommodations have been provided; and
> 
> · Providing PAS will not impose undue hardship on the agency.

Although distinguishable from Requests for Accommodation, requests for PAS will be initiated and processed and addressed in the same manner as Requests for Accommodation.

Questions regarding this notice and requests for PAS should be directed to Teresa Slater, Human Resources Specialist, at (928) 779-2721, ext 122 or via e-mail at tslater@onhir.gov.
