The Federal Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) is a key tool in assessing policies, programs, and other aspects of work environment as viewed by ONHIR employees. The survey was designed to specifically provide agency leadership with insight into the unique strengths and challenges of their individual employee populations as well as giving federal employees a voice to point out inefficiencies and jobs well done.
