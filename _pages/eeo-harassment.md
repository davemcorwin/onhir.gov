Harassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\. ONHIR as an employer and a Federal agency is committed to creating and maintaining a workplace environment that encourages and empowers each individual employee to perform at this or her best.

Harassment, therefore, has no place in the workplace at ONHIR and the agency has a longstanding policy that harassment in the workplace is prohibited and will not be tolerated. This applies to harassment by anyone, including supervisors, co-workers, and contract personnel.

Harassment is unwelcome conduct, verbal or physical, based on an individuals’ race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, religion, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, retaliation when:

> · The behavior can reasonably be considered to adversely affect the work environment
> 
> · An employment decision affecting the employee is based upon the employee’s acceptance or rejection of such conduct

Assurance will be given that employees who make claims of harassment or provide information related to such claims will be protected against retaliation.

All ONHIR managers, supervisors and employees have a role to play in helping to maintain a work environment that is free from harassing conduct. Examples of harassing behavior consistent with ONHIR’s policy include, but are not limited to, the following:

> · Threatening or intimidation that rejection of sexual overtures will affect appointment, promotions, transfers or evaluations.
> 
> · Creating belittling caricatures or objects depicting persons of a particular race, national origin, religion or other protected category.
> 
> · Telling racial or ethnic jokes or stories.
> 
> · Teasing, mimicking or repeatedly commenting on an individual’s disability, accent or other protected category.
> 
> · Making offensive comments, jokes or suggestions about an employee’s gender.
> 
> · Making obscene or lewd comments, slurs, jokes, epithets, suggestions or gestures.
> 
> · Commenting on an employee’s body or sexual characteristics.
> 
> · Displaying rude or sexually suggestive objects, pictures, images or cartoons.
> 
> · Continuing prohibited behavior after a co-worker has objected.
> 
> · Laughing at, ignoring, or retaliating against an employee who complains.

The conduct must be unwelcome and therefore, the perspective of the person subjected to the behavior as to whether the behavior is viewed as offensive, demeaning, or hostile is a primary consideration whether the behavior constitutes harassing conduct.

An employee who believes he or she has been subjected to harassing conduct can report the matter to his or her immediate supervisor, the agency Anti-Harassment Coordinator (AHC), or the Human Resources Director. ONHIR will not tolerate retaliation against a person who raises harassment concerns. Any employee who violates this policy or asserts a false claim with malicious intent will be subject to appropriate discipline, up to and including termination. Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the individuals bringing harassment claims. A contract employee who is alleging harassment by an ONHIR employee, or vice versa, should report to the AHC for guidance and processing consistent with these procedures.

Anti-Harassment procedures set up a process for management to address employee allegations of harassment and take immediate and appropriate corrective action, including the use of disciplinary actions to eliminate harassing conduct regardless of whether the conduct violated the law. The goal of this policy is to address harassing conduct at the earliest stage before it can become “severe or pervasive” harassment within the meaning of anti-discrimination laws.

A prompt, thorough and impartial investigation of all complaints will be conducted. Supervisors or managers who observe or are notified of harassing conduct are required to assess the situation immediately and consult with the Anti-Harassment Coordinator, as well as subject matter experts in Human Resources and Equal Employment Opportunity communities. After consultation with the AHC and other officials, supervisors and managers and the AHC will conduct an appropriate inquiry or fact-finding. Depending on the circumstances the supervisor may also be advised to provide appropriate interim relief during the process.

The supervisor, in consultation with the AHC and subject matter experts, will make the ultimate determination as to whether the conduct violated the policy. If so, will determine what type of corrective action is warranted. The agency will assure that all investigations take place immediately and are completed within 14 days. Any employee, supervisor or manager who is found to have violated ONHIR’s Anti-Harassment Policy or procedures may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including removal.

The anti-harassment procedures do not affect EEO complaint process rights. The anti-harassment process is entirely separate from the EEO process. An employee who reports allegation of harassment in accordance with this policy and procedures has not filed an EEO complaint. An employee who wishes to file an EEO discrimination complaint should contact the agency contracted EEO office within 45 days.

The Human Resources office in conjunction with the Anti-Harassment Coordinator will assure that all supervisors and managers receive periodic training in the Anti-Harassment Policy and procedures of this agency.
