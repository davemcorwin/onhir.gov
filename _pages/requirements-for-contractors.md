Contractors interested in building relocation houses must have a current state residential construction license in good standing. All specialty subcontractors, such as electrical, plumbing and mechanical, must have a current state license in good standing. The license must be in the state where (Example, Arizona, New Mexico or Utah) the work is to be performed.

Requirements that must be met before a house can be built for or be purchased by an eligible family:

Per 25 CFR, Chapter IV, § 700.55 Decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling.  
(a) General. The term decent, safe and sanitary dwelling means a dwelling which:

(1) Meets the most current edition of the International Residential Code, and agency “Specifications and Materials Description”, known as Exhibit G, for new construction.

(2) Is structurally sound, clean, weather tight and in good repair and has adequate living space and number of rooms.

(3) Has an adequate and safe electrical wiring system for lighting and other electrical services.

(4) Meets the requirements of the HUD lead-based paint regulations (24 CFR part 42) issued under the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4831 et seq.);

(5) In the case of a physically handicapped person, is free of any architectural barriers. To the extent that standards prescribed by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., in publication ANSI A117.1-1961 (R 1971) are pertinent, this provision will be considered met if it meets those standards;

(6) Has heating as required by IRC and Exhibit G, for new construction.

(7) In the case of new construction or modular housing, complies with the energy performance standards for new residential construction as required by the most recent edition of the IRC.

(8) The commission may waive paragraph (a) (3) or (6) of this section on a case by case basis if it is determined that it is in the best interest of the individual relocatee to do so.
