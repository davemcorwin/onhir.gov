**COMMITMENT TO EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY POLICY**

                                 POLICY STATEMENT FOR JANUARY 1, 2019 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019  

I AM AFFIRMING THIS AGENCY'S COMMITMENT TO TITLE VII OF THE CIVL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964\. CONSISTENT WITH THIS  
COMMITMENT, THE ONHIR IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING OUR WORKPLACE REFLECTS THE VALUES AS STATED BY  
LAW.  

ONHIR'S OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE A WORK ENVIRONMENT FREE OF UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION AND  
TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO ENSURE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL EMPLOYEES AND APPLICANTS  
FOR EMPLOYMENT WITH THE AGENCY. ONHIR EMPLOYEES ARE PROTECTED BY FEDERAL LAWS PROHIBITING  
DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE, RELIGION, COLOR, SEX (INCLUDING PREGNANCY AND GENDER IDENTITY),  
NATIONAL ORIGIN, AGE, DISABILITY, FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY, OR GENETIC INFORMATION. MOREOVER,  
CONSISTENT WITH PRESIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND OTHER LAWS DESIGNED TO PROTECT FEDERAL  
EMPLOYEES, WE MUST VIGILANTLY PREVENT DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION, PARENTAL STATUS,  
MARITAL STATUS, POLITICAL AFFILIATION, MILITARY SERVICE OR ANY OTHER NON-MERIT BASED FACTOR. THESE  
COMMITMENTS MUST BE EXEMPLIFIED IN ALL OF OUR MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND DECISIONS, INCLUDING  
RECRUITMENT AND HIRING PRACTICES, APPRAISAL SYSTEMS, PROMOTIONS, TRAINING AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT  
PROGRAMS.  

ONHIR'S OBJECTIVE IS TO ALSO ENSURE THAT AGENCY EMPLOYEES WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED  
AGAINST ARE FULLY ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE AN EEO COMPLAINT OR GRIEVANCE OR OTHERWISE  
OPPOSE UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION. CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAWS, ACTS OF  
RETALIATION AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE WHO ENGAGED IN A PROTECTED ACTIVITY, WHISTLE BLOWING, OR THE  
EXERCISE OF ANY APPEAL OR GRIEVANCE RIGHT PROVIDED BY LAW WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.  
ONHIR MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS ARE REMINDED OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT, DOCUMENT AND  
PROMPTLY CORRECT HARASSING CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE. EMPLOYEES ARE URGED TO REPORT ACTS OF  
HARASSMENT TO THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY OFFICIALS AS OUTLINED IN THE AGENCY'S ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY.  

ONHIR'S OBJECTIVE IS TO COMPLY WITH EEO LAWS WHICH PROHIBIT PUNiSHING JOB APPLICANTS OR  
EMPLOYEES FOR ASSERTING THEIR RIGHTS TO BE FREE FROM EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION INCLUDING  
HARASSMENT. ASSERTING THESE EEO RIGHTS IS CALLED "PROTECTED ACTIVITY" AND IT CAN TAKE MANY  
FORMS. PARTICIPATING IN A COMPLAINT PROCESS IS PROTECTED FROM RETALIATION UNDER ALL  
CIRCUMSTANCES. OTHER ACTS TO OPPOSE DISCRIMINATION ARE PROTECTED AS LONG AS THE EMPLOYEE WAS  
ACTING ON A REASONABLE BELIEF THAT SOMETHING IN THE WORK PLACE MAY VIOLATE EEO LAWS EVEN IF HE  
OR SHE DID NOT USE LEGAL TERMINOLOGY TO DESCRIBE IT.  

ONHIR MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS ARE REMINDED IT IS UNLAWFUL TO RETALIATE AGAINST APPLICANTS OR  
EMPLOYEES FOR FILING OR ENGAGING IN AN EEO COMPLAINT PROCESS.  

ANY EMPLOYEE WHO FEELS THAT HE OR SHE HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO ONE OF THESE FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION  
OR RETALIATION SHOULD CONTACT TERESA SLATER IN THE ONHIR HUMAN RESOURCES BRANCH OR THE AGENCY'S  
CONTRACTED EEO OFFICER, JOSEPH URBANO, 1905 ANASAZI COURT, COLORADO SPRINGS, CO (719) 522-1833, OR AS  
APPROPRIATE THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL AT (202) 254-3600 OR THE MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD AT  
(202) 653-7200.  

THE TIMEFRAME FOR ESTABLISHING AN EEO CONTACT FOR FILING A DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT IS 45 DAYS FROM  
THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE. HOLIDAYS AND WEEKEND ARE INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION ALTHOUGH IF THE  
DEADLINE FALLS ON A WEEKEND OR A HOLIDAY, INDIVIDUALS HAVE UNTIL THE NEXT BUSINESS DAY TO FILE A  
COMPLAINT.  

IT IS INCUMBENT UPON EVERY EMPLOYEE OF THE AGENCY TO ENSURE THAT THE ONHIR STANDS AS AN EXEMPLAR  
OF EQUITY AND INCLUSIVENESS AND THAT EACH EMPLOYEE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTING THE  
OFFICE'S EEO POLICY AND COOPERATING FULLY IN ITS ENFORCEMENT.  

THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED DEDICATION TO FULFILLING THE MISSION OF OUR AGENCY.  

Christopher J. Bavasi, Executive Director  3/28/2019
