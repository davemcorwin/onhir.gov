ONHIR FEVS Survey Narrative

The Federal Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) is a key tool in assessing policies, programs, and other aspects of work environment as viewed by ONHIR employees.  The survey was designed to specifically provide agency leadership with insight into the unique strengths and challenges of their individual employee populations as well as giving federal employees a voice to point out inefficiencies and jobs well done.   OPM and Senior Managers will utilize the data from the survey to develop policy and planning actions to improve agency performance and to evaluate individual agencies progress in reaching long term goals.  Information from the survey results will be helpful to agencies in identifying opportunities for change and to increase potential achievements and successes.
The survey was administered via the Web by the Office of Personnel Management to 82 federal agencies, 37 which were departmental/large agencies and 45 which were small/independent agencies.
The survey was conducted online from May 27 to July 2, 2012.   The 98 item survey included 84 items that measured Federal employees’ perceptions and surveyed employees about how effectively agencies manage their workforce, as well as 14 demographic items.   The survey was grouped into 8 topic areas:  Personal Work Experiences, Work Unit, Agency, Supervisor/Team Leader, Leadership, Satisfaction, Work/Life Programs and Demographics.
All full time permanent employees of the agency were surveyed.  Of the 38 surveys administered to ONHIR employees, 32 employees participated for a response rate of 84%.
Survey items with response choices and number of respondents for each question are attached in the Agency Results Report.
Based on 2012 FEVS results the agency scored particularly high percentages in the categories of “Work Experience” and “Job Satisfaction”.  Employee respondents rated the question “considering everything, how satisfied are you with your job?” at 95% positive.   Employee respondents also rated the questions “I think the work I do is important” and the question “I know my work relates to the agency’s goals and priorities” both at a 100% positive rating.   Additionally, employee respondents are satisfied with the Work/Life programs that the agency offers.
The agency scored lowest in categories of “My Work Unit” and “My Agency” where the question “promotions in my work unit are based on merit” was rated at 59% positive by employee respondents. For the question “creativity and innovation are rewarded” and “pay raises depend on how well employees perform their jobs” both were  rated at 56% positive by employee respondents.
