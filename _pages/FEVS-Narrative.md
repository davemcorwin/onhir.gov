Full FEVS Narrative

ONHIR FEVS Survey Narrative
The Federal Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) is a key tool in assessing policies, programs, and other aspects of work environment as viewed by ONHIR employees.  The survey is issued annually to Federal agencies by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to 65 small federal agencies as well as 37 large federal agencies.   

The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey is designed to provide an overview of survey results, enabling agencies to identify issues and take action for improvement.  The survey is helpful in providing a starting point for analysis of the agency’s OPM FEVS results, acting as an agency overview and for an in depth analysis. This report highlights important agency successes and areas of improvement which should be acknowledged. 

The 2019 survey was administered online to ONHIR employees from May 23 to July 5, 2019.  The 2019 survey had a response rate of 52%.   Survey items with response choices and number of respondents for each question are attached.  The 2019 survey results were categorized with indices which include the Employee Engagement Index, New IQ Index and Global Satisfaction Index to provide consistent metrics for measuring progress toward objectives. Benchmarks are included to provide insight into how the ONHIR compares to other agencies.   Trends for all three indices referenced are displayed to help agencies in the survey to recognize where there were improvements or declines in results from the previous year.   

Based on 2019 FEVS results the agency scored particularly high percentages in the following indices:
 Employee Engagement Index:   
   •	Leaders Lead - 61%:   My agency’s leadership fosters motivation and commitment; maintains high integrity; communicates the agency’s goals, and earns respect from employees.
   •	Supervisors - 70%:  My supervisor supports employee development, listens to me, treats me with respect, and has my trust and    confidence.
   •	Intrinsic Work Experience - 83%:  As an employee, the work I do is important, I feel encouraged to do better, feel accomplished, know what’s expected of me and know how my job relates to agency goals.
   
Global Satisfaction Index:
   •	Job Satisfaction:  78% 
   •	Pay Satisfaction:   78%:  
   •	Organizational Satisfaction:  63%:  
   •	Recommend Organization: 77%:  
   •	Work Life Program Satisfaction:   100%
   
Those areas of the survey where there were decreases that fell below the 65% or more positive threshold were:
•	The skill level in my work unit has improved in the past year:  23 negative (-33)
•	My training needs are assessed: 6 negative (-28)
•	My work unit differences in performance are recognized in a meaningful way: 19 negative (-23)
•	Employees have a feeling of personal empowerment with respect to work processes: 14 negative (-20)

The information provided in this narrative was derived from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey.  The survey has been revised over the years to reflect various benchmarks and sub-index scores and trends to better assess results.
