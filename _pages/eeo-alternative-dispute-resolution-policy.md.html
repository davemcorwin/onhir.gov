It is the policy of the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation to use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in resolving Equal Employment Opportunity discrimination complaints during both the pre-complaint and formal complaint process.    ONHIR’s ADR program is established in accordance with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulation published in 29 C.F.R. 1614.102(b)(2).

The objectives of the ADR program are to reduce the number of EEO complaint cases, reduce expenses incurred through the traditional administrative complaint process, reduce employees’/managers’ time spent in litigation and away from the job, improve overall organizational ability to resolve conflict early in the dispute and at the lowest level possible, improve morale, improve productivity and performance.  The core principles of the ADR program are voluntariness, neutrality, confidentiality and enforceability.

For further information on the ONHIR ADR program contact the Human Resources Officer.
