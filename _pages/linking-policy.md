ONHIR exercises sound judgment when linking to other government-owned or supported Web sites as well as non-government sites. ONHIR links to other Web sites when we believe such sites:

1.  Complement existing information, products, and services on ONHIR.gov
2.  Are accessible and applicable to a wide audience
3.  Contain relevant, useful**,** and authoritative content for citizens, businesses, and/or government officials
4.  Appear to be accurate and current
5.  Link to other government agencies or cross intergovernmental boundaries (e.g., students.gov, fedforms.gov, and nutrition.gov)

The information contained on linked Web sites may not be exclusive, and could be found elsewhere on the Internet or other resources. ONHIR.gov is providing these links as a convenience and our Web users may choose not to link to Web sites outside of ONHIR.gov.

**Links to Government Web sites**  
ONHIR.gov may include links to any government Web site that is publicly available unless directed not to by the agency that owns the site. Acceptable Federal government-owned or government-sponsored Web site domains include .gov, .mil, .fed, and .us. ONHIR.gov also may link to quasi-official government agencies and Web sites managed by public sector/private sector partnerships (e.g., Smithsonian Institution, United States Institute of Peace); State and local government sites (e.g., www.arizona.gov); and some government-sponsored Web sites that end in .com, .org, or .net (e.g., www.usps.com for the U.S. Postal Service).

**Links to Non-Government Web sites**  
In rare instances, ONHIR.gov links to Web sites that are not government-owned or government-sponsored if these Web sites provide relevant information and/or services in a way that is not available on an official government Web site. ONHIR.gov provides links to these non-government Web sites as a public service only because we believe the information contained on those sites may be relevant and useful to our Web site users. The U.S. Government, including ONHIR, does not guarantee in any way the external organizations’ services, advice, or products included on their Web sites. Furthermore, the U.S. Government does not control nor guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of the information contained on non-government Web sites.

**Reciprocal Links**  
ONHIR.gov links to other government information according to our linking policy, whether or not the other Web site links to us. We do not engage in reciprocal linking. We invite any Web site to link to ONHIR.gov in order to provide consistent, relevant, useful, and authoritative information for its Web users. ONHIR.gov is the official Web site for the Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation. ONHIR.gov is a public domain Web site, which means you may link to it and download information at no cost and without special permission.

**Prohibitions**  
ONHIR.gov will not intentionally link to any Web site that exhibits hate, bias, discrimination, or other inappropriate information. Furthermore, ONHIR.gov reserves the right to deny access to or remove any link that contains misleading information or unsubstantiated claims, or is determined to be in conflict with ONHIR’s mission and policies.

**Disclaimer of Endorsement**  
When you select a link to a Web site outside of ONHIR.gov, you are leaving our site and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the outside Web site. ONHIR.gov provides these outside links solely for your information and convenience.  
ONHIR does not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained on a linked Web site.  
ONHIR does not endorse the organizations sponsoring linked Web sites, and we do not endorse the views they express or the products/services they offer.  
ONHIR cannot authorize the use of copyrighted materials contained in linked Web sites. You must request such authorization from the sponsor of the linked Web site.  
ONHIR does not guarantee that outside Web sites comply with Section 508 (Accessibility Requirements) of the Rehabilitation Act. We make an effort to link to sites that are accessible to a wide audience. Please refer to the accessibility notice for that site.
